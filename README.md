This project uses opencv, mediapipe, scipy and winsound libraries to detect if a personn has closed his eyes for more than 2 secs. 
This is done by calculating EYE ASPECT RATIO of the face using landmarks all around the face and settiing a threshold.
When the EAR reaches beyond the threshold, a beep sound is produced to indicate the person is drowsi.
This ML project does not use any dataset which saves spacc and increases the speed.
